# Matthes-Python-Crash-Course-Learning 🐍📚

This repository is where I chronicle my journey through the "Python Crash Course" (3rd Edition) by Eric Matthes. It's a space to share my solutions to the exercises and to reflect on what I've learned from this fantastic introduction to programming with Python.

Each directory corresponds to a chapter or concept from the book, containing Python scripts (`*.py`) with my personal solutions and insights. This repository aims to complement the [official resources](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/) by providing my unique approach to solving the exercises.
